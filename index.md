Hello! I'm Maxis, a third year math PhD student in the [mathematics department](https://www-math.umd.edu/) at the University of Maryland, College Park. I obtained my bachelor of science degree in mathematics from Xiamen University Malaysia in 2021. Outside of work I like taking naps, as I only work best when I get enough rest.

 Mathematics is only one out of many other things I'm interested in. I say more [here](\personal), where I talk a little bit more about my personal background.
