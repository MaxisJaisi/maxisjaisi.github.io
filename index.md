Welcome! I'm Maxis, a math PhD student in the [Mathematics Department](https://www-math.umd.edu/) at the University of Maryland, College Park. I started in August 2022. Outside of work I like taking naps, as I only work best when I get enough rest.

 Mathematics is only one out of many other things I'm interested in. I share more about this and a little about my personal background [here](\personal).
